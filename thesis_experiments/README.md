# Experiments conducted in thesis

The notebooks in this directory is linked to the experiments conducted in the thesis (soon to be uploaded). One thing to keep in mind is that namings of the experiments were changed when writing the thesis, and this has not been updated in the notebooks since that would require a major refactoring to avoid breaking dependencies.

| Thesis                            | Notebooks                                                                                             | Comments                                                                                                                 |

| E1: The baseline experiment       | `experiment-01-band-configurations.ipynb`                                                               |                                                                                                                          |
| E2: The regularization experiment | `experiment-04-oversampling.ipynb` <br /> `experiment-05-augment.ipynb` <br /> `experiment-06-os-aug.ipynb` | Each notebook does its own adaptation of the data pipeline that matches with the three versions presented in the thesis. |
| E3: The final evaluation          | `experiment-07-final.ipynb`                                                                             | Here the test set is used as the data source                                                                             |
